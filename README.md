# Plant Shelf 🌱
### 🎍 About this Project:
A personal project developed for plant management, allowing users to keep track of their plant's important information. Having this information on record can help plant hobbyists identify possible health issues with their plants.
Additional goals of this project are to expand my knowledge on C# and keep my skills up to date.

### 🌿 Current Features:
-> Adding new plants to your gallery.
-> Viewing all saved plants.

-> Editing a specific plant from your gallery.

### 🌷 Planned Features:
-> Removing unwanted plants from your gallery.

-> An infirmiry page to easily keep track of sick plants.

-> A graveyard page to keep track of deceased plants and their cause of death. This page will allow users to keep track of all the plants they've ever owned and see trends linked to their plants' death.

-> A facts page for quick research on specific, plant-related issues.

-> A water tracking system to let users know when their plants need watering.
